#summary Rationale for OpenHandle

== OpenHandle Rationale ==

Running a handle client natively usually means writing Java code which communicates with a handle server over port 2641 inbound/outbound traffic which inevitably leads to firewall issues within many organizations. (There is also a C library - but the Java code is the reference implementation.)

Alternately a handle server can be reached through a web service over an HTTP port:

  * Resolver
   ** lookup: http://hdl.handle.net/
   ** service: e.g. http://dx.doi.org/
  * Admin
   ** web forms:

To open up handle means the ability to interact with a handle server using standard web services:

  * Standard port
   ** port 80 rather than 2641
  * Standard object
   ** common text-based markup as return object rather than native binary object
  * Structured format - differently from existing lookup web services returns
   ** "structured" format
   ** "complete" record

== Standard Port ==

As HTTP-based network endpoint returning markup body simple to request and consume from any language (e.g. Perl, Python, Ruby, Java, C?C++, .NET, etc.).


== Standard Object ==

  * As RDF/XML or RDF/N3 can be consumed as an RDF datasource (mozilla) or merged with other RDF datasources

  * As JSON very amenable to Web 2.0 type apps

== Structured Format ==

Having a structured format means more control facilitating new services.

complete record

 handle record is set of handle values containg mix of data and admin fields. not always clear where the bundaries are, i.e. some admin-type fields can be used as data
